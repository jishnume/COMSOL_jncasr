# How to install COMSOL Multiplhysics

##### by - [Jishnu Goswami](https://github.com/jishnume), MS Engg., EMU (2021-2024)

To install COMSOL Multiphysics, we need an installation file and a license file.

### Getting the installation file

At present, this comsol installation is tied to my [comsol access](https://www.comsol.com/access/login) account. In future, any of the lab member can create their own access account.  Creating this account is free of cost and upon providing some details, it can be created easily.

**Note**: Any issue regarding the installation should be communicated to [Reshma Tauro](reshma@comsol.com), licensing manager in COMSOL.

Inside the comsol access account, you can [download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10m34MS7Iz3jNSB-WtSl8sXO9fE0qi2Pg/view?usp=sharing) the latest version of COMSOL Multiphysics. At present (as on 16 September 2024), the version is COMSOL6.2.
